Implementation of Percentage Closer Filtering (PCF) and Percentage-Closer Soft Shadows (PCSS) in OpenGL. Features a small ImGui configuration panel for adjusting various parameters at runtime. The first prototype was written as part of a school project, but has since been heavily modified and refactored.

#### Helpful resources

These explanations and code snippets were particularly useful to me when first learning about soft shadow rendering. You may find them helpful as well.
